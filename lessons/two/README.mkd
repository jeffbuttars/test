# Lesson 2

Now that we've had the RoboCode introduction we need to have an Eclipse introduction.

What's Eclipse?
What's an IDE?
Why and IDE?
What's a text editor?
What's the difference between a text editor and an IDE?
    Why use a text editor then?

There are lot's of IDEs available, why use Eclipse?
    It's very popular, lot's of docs.
    It's open source.
    It's what's documented by FIRST Robotics.
    But it's not necessarily the best.
